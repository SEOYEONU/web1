<h2>comfort women</h2>
<br><br><p><a href="https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%9C%84%ED%82%A4%EB%B0%B1%EA%B3%BC:%EB%8C%80%EB%AC%B8" target="-blank" title="comfort women">Girls</a> are taken to the Japanese army during Japanese occupation.
They are used as sexual slaves and war tools.</p><p>And they couln't go out.
Only followed orders,and couldn't speak Korean.It isn't only a moral
obligation</p><p> to fight for survivors but for the future of our society.
So i chose to let a lot of people know.I think that Japan</p><p> should apologize
to the victims.the solution is to let foreginers know about this,and to
volunteer to help the victims<p> of Japanese military sexual slavery.
If we come together and fix this,<u>we'll be stronger as people.</u></p>
